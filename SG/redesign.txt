Maybe this is a new game, but here is a simplified version.

Maybe no/little combat, but a far flung trading game. With that, you would certainly need fuel. Could hire folks, to make runs, too.
Different places might degrade different ships. Gold Rush in the galaxy. W00t. See if that is sufficient to not need combat.

Maybe something like monopoly. You can pay for claims and then rent them out. You could have wildcatters who just mine without claims. If
they are caught, they are fined? Or you do have to go there and plop down a flag or something. Read up on the gold rush.

Just one system with a few planets of different orbits.
( dont orbit yet, just give distances from each other )

page 2 : in game menu :
    location
    total value
    debts
    warehouse contents (buy/sell)
    ships (buy/sell)

 in order to buy or sell, each party must have a ship, 
     office or warehouse in the location

more detail on UI screens ( and maybe this is a different game, the space trade game )

elements of
 - building
 - motion
 - spending resources

There are ships and buildings and places and resources. Everything can be bought and sold.
There is an authority that regulates plots of land. There can be wildcatting, but that means
multiple people can be mining a plot at once and dividing the bounty. 
The goal is to have the most luxury goods in the time allotted. 
There can be debts ( and possibly the ability to buy and sell them ). 

The goal is to have the most stuff, I suppose.

resources :
  - fuel
  - ore
  -

  The goal of this game is to retire with the most toys 
  You can buy ships, offices, mining claims, factories 
  ((banks)), and refineries. You can create ship designs.
  You can sell your debt to finance you endevors.
  You can mine ores and fuel. You can sell what you've 
  mined to refineries and factories. There are even
  credits that you can use. ((If you own a bank, you can
  charge a fee for each transaction, either fixed,
  percentage and have a minimum charge -- or maybe
  banking is automatic ))
