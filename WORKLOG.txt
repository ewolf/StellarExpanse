Immediate Stack

break the sectors a player knows about into 3 categories :

* unexplored
* owned
* explored not owned

data sources :
  - player starmap has a hash of sector id --> node
  - player sector list

* a node is unexplored when the discovered value is 0
* a node is owned when in the player sector list
* a node is explored not owned when it is not unexplored and not in 
   the player sector list

* <@  and <% with new forms to allow a list to be specified right there?

make a current sector area in the UI
